intro:

    - <b>Hi there, I'm Lynn.</b> (Feeling adventurous? Trying pronouncing my given name, Ruolin, pronounced <i>RU-LEEN</i>.)

    - I'm a rising senior at <b>UChicago</b> pursuing a joint Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science with a Specialization in Machine Learning as well as a Bachelor's degree in Statistics. I'm graduating in June 2021.

    - During the summer of 2020, I interned at <b>Salesforce</b> and built a feature for Salesforce Lightning Web Components that addresses the pain point of 300+ Salesforce developers. During the summer of 2019, I interned at VIA Technologies and built from scratch a PC App for home security cameras.

    - My most proficient programming languages are Python, Java, and C/C++. I  have experience in iOS Development, Android Development, Machine Learning, Speech Processing, Computer Systems, and Web Development from my other internships, coursework, and extracurricular activities.

    - Outside the classroom, I'm the Program Development Chair of <b>UChicago TechTeam</b>, a student-led civic tech organization. This fall quarter is the third year in a row that I'll be leading weekly workshops on Python and Data Analysis. I also love working on open-source projects and am a proud <b>GitHub Arctic Code Vault Contributor</b>. My passion project for the summer of 2020 is a chess engine for a popular game development engine.
