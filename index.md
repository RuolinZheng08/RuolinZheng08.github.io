intro:
  - Hi there, I'm Lynn. (Feeling adventurous? Trying pronouncing my first name: Ruolin, pronounced <i>RU-LEEN</i>.) Iâ€™m a rising senior student at the University of Chicago double-majoring in Computer Science and Statistics. I'll be graduating in June 2021 with a joint Bachelor's and Master's degree (Bx/MS) in Computer Science and a BA in Statistics.
  - The summer of 2020, I'm a Backend Engineering Intern at Salesforce working on Team Industries - HealthCloud. The summer of 2019, I interned as a PC App Engineering Intern and built from scratch a Windows PC App for home security cameras.
  - My most proficient programming languages are Python, Java, and C/C++. I  have experience in Machine Learning, Speech Processing, Computer Systems, and Web Development from my other internships, coursework, and extracurricular activities. 
  - Outside the classroom, I've been the Program Development Chair of UChicago TechTeam, a student-led civic tech organization, for three years. Every fall, I led weekly workshops on topics like Python for Data Analysis. I also love working on side projects involving Web Development and Machine Learning.
