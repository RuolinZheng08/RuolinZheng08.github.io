I am Ruolin, a UChicago CS student by day and an amateur Visual Novel Game Dev in my spare time. My other hobbies include but are not limited to: Digital Arts, reading, and sports (swimming, running, rope skipping, you name it). This blog
is dedicated to the moments when my notions of fun coincide with my skills ;)
