Hello, I'm Ruolin (pronounced *ru-leen*), or you can just call me Lynn. I'm a junior student at the University of Chicago double-majoring in Computer Science and Statistics.

I have experience in Machine Learning, APP Development, and Web Development from my coursework, internships, and extracurricular activities. Take a look at my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/resume.pdf">resume</a> or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruolin-zheng/).

## Coursework

I've taken many CS courses at UChicago that I find immensely interesting and intellectually challenging, for example:

- CMSC 25400 Machine Learning, in which I completed 5 projects ranging from Clustering to a Long-Short Term Memory Model. Read more in my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/_posts/2019-03-20-ml-projects">blog post</a> or visit my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RuolinZheng08/cmsc25400-machine-learning).

- CMSC 23010 Parallel Computing, in which I practiced multi-thread programming and implemented concurrent data structures like lock-free queues, linked lists, and hash tables. For more details, visit my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RuolinZheng08/cmsc23010-parallel-computing
).

- ARTV 16210 Media Arts and Design Practice, not really a CS class, but I found a passion for glitch art and created Python scripts for creating glitch art for my class project. Check out my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RuolinZheng08/glitch-art).


## Internships

### Summer 2019

I interned as a Embedded IoT Software Developer at [VIA Technologies](https://www.viatech.com/en/). Learn more about my internship experience in my [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbz8YuNz9W4). 

My first project was to build from scratch in C++ a PC APP for home security cameras. The APP is called VPai Home and will be released this October. My second project was to improve the stability and performance of the distributed TCP server which relays messages between VPai Home PC, iOS, Android and the cameras. The server is written in Go.

### Summer of 2018

I worked as a research assistant and curriculum development intern at Dr. Diana Franklin's research lab.
