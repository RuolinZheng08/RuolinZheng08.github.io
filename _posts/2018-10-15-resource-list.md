This list will be reguarly updated as I seek out more awesome entry-level online learning resources.

- [Udacity CS 101 Intro to Comp Sci](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101)   
Hands-on experience building a Search Engine and a Social Network in Python. A must for learning the ways of approaching problems from a programmer's perspective.
- [codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)   
Everthing you need from the language tutorials themselves (Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Ruby, the list goes on and one) to projects to showcase on your resume.
- [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org)   
Found this on [Medium](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/). You can tell JavaScript is involved by its Camel-Casing name. It offers detailed, interactive lessons for Web Development.
