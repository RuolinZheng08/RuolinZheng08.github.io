      I’m a junior student at the University of Chicago double-majoring in Computer Science and Statistics. I’m looking for internship opportunities in Software Engineering for the summer of 2020.

      My most proficient programming languages are Python, C/C++. I worked as an Embedded IoT Software Development Intern in my most recent internship, building a PC App for home security cameras. I also have experience in Machine Learning, Computer Systems, and Web Development from my other internships, coursework, and extracurricular activities. 
      </div>
      Outside the classroom, I love working on side projects in Web Development, Game Development, and so on. I’m also the Program Development Chair of UChicago TechTeam, a student civic tech organization. I lead weekly workshops on topics like Python for Data Analysis.
