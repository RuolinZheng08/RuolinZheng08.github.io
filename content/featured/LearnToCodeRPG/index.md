A visual novel game where you can learn to code and break into tech. I created the game for [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), the biggest global non-profit with the mission to help everyone learn to code for free. The game features hours of play time, 600+ CS quiz questions, and more.
