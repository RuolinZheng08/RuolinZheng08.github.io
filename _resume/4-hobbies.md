        description: "I started doodling earlier than I could remember and took some drawing classes at 8. I've been drawing with my tablet & iPad for 4 years now. I've created art merchandise for my high school's Anime Club fund-raising expo. I'm still an amateur but I'm proud to say that one of my drawing was featured on <a href=\"https://aminoapps.com/c/art/page/blog/eat-that-frog/MVhk_ugarMWx1gr1q6RXNa162Qqzak\" target=\"_blank\">Art Amino</a> with 600+ likes :)"
